# Common Object Management Service

A microservice for managing access control to files in S3-compatible Object Storage

Take advantage of more cost-effective storage solutions for your new or existing business applications. Common Object Management Service (COMS) is a secure REST API that lets you connect your application to an S3 bucket. In S3, you can store and share files, images, and documents with co-workers, partners, or the public.

## Onboarding Options

COMS is now available as a shared hosted service as well as an application that you can customise and deploy in your own infrastructure.<br />
See documentation on [Hosting Considerations](Hosting-Considerations.md).

We have also launched [BCBox](https://bcbox.nrs.gov.bc.ca), a DropBox-like user-interface for managing files, integrated with the hosted COMS service.

## Feature List

- Upload, download, manage and delete files
- Manage file versions and soft-deletes
- Enable general public access to files
- Grant permissions on buckets and files to authenticated users (eg IDIR or BCeID)
- Share and invite users to work with your files
- Manage metadata and tags on objects
- Flexible search and filter capabilities based on objects attributes and user permissions
- Sync COMS with files that already exist in your bucket
